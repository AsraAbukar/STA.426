>This is a tutorial (primarly for myself) on how to use markdown

If you want to make your text **bold** you need to use (**) before and after your text.   
You also can make your text _italics_ by putting (_) before and after your text.   
You can also make your text **_bold and italics_** which increases the fun    
you can also add [links](https://www.google.ch) of you favorite website.  
Can you guess what my favorite site is?  
Have a guess....  
Yes, it is everyones favorite search engine   ![Google](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/375px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png)
